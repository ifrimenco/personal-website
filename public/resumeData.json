    "bio": "I've been passionate about Technology, Science and Astronomy since I know myself. As my passion grew, so did my problem-solving skills and mindset. In middle school I used to repair neighbors' computers for snack money. Being born in a village near Focsani, Romania, I went afterwards to study Computer Science at the University of Bucharest. With the passing of time, another passion grew in me, the one to help the world. From delivering quality software to planting trees.",
